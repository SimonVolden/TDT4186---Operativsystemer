              CSS is used to align content and text, and make the website react
              to different browser-sizes. This is done by making a style.css
              file, and making custom css classes for the different containers.
              These are then used in the HTML file. I have chosen to go for a
              simple layout where the content is centered, with the two
              "art-pieces" next to each other, but if the browser-window is too
              small, they will render underneath each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have created two "artworks" which are created using two
              different methods, one using hardcoded SVG, and the other using
              the Canvas API. Both are based on the same painting, and both are
              animated. However they are drawn and animated in two different
              ways. The one on the left (svg) is drawn and animated using SVG
              and animateMotion, while the one on the right is drawn and
              animated using Canvas and javascript-logic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The animations are also a bit different between the two, with the
              one on the left having shapes which move from side to side, while
              the one on the right "exploding" and bouncing with some physics.
              The reason why I have chosen to bot make the two animations the
              same, is that I want to highlight the different strengths and
              weaknesses between the two animation API's. On one hand CSS
              keyframes are easy to use when having figures move to
              predetermined positions, but is not optimal for physics like
              movement. Using Canvas, the shapes can be drawn in a set position
              each frame, and this can be easily controlled by using some
              javascript code.
            </p>

              jQuery is used to show and hide this documentation, using some
              simple logic on the button below, in combination with css styling.

              Cross-browser testing has been conducted by opening the website in
              three different browsers: Opera-GX, Google Chrome and Microsoft
              Edge. It has been observed that the site behaves identically
              between these browsers.
